### Quectel L80 and L86 GPS Breakout Board

This is a board that allows you to use a low cost Quectel L80 or L80 GPS with your micro controller projects. In its simplest build all you need to do is solder the GPS module to the board, add a 4 pin 0.1‚Äù header and make two links. This is a board for the GPS only, you will need to supply your own GPS. 

There are options you can add to the board;

LED fix indicator
Extra decoupling capacitors
Lithium backup battery
Power switching to turn the GPS off and save power.

The board uses 0805 sized surface mount components to keep the size and weight down. 

**The assembled GPS module is for use on 3.3V microcontroller projects only**

**Do not connect directly to 5V microcontrollers such as the Arduino UNO.**

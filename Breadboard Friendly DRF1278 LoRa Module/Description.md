### Breadboard Friendly DRF1278 LoRa Module


This module is a 433Mhz Dorji DRF1278F lora module fitted to a breadboard friendly breakout board. The board will allow you to use the DRF1278F with a standard 0.1” matrix breadboard or stripboards. 

The module is supplied with the DRF1278F  module and edge SMA antenna connector fitted. The module is however supplied with the 0.1" pins** unsoldered** so leaving you the option of how to assemble or use the board in a project. 

The module can be used with a simple wire antenna about 17.5cm long instead of using the SAM socket. If you want to do this please add a comment with the order to have the module supplied with the SMA edge socket un-soldered. 
This board can be used with the  Easy mikroBUS™ Pro Mini controller available in my store. 

**Do not operate the DRF1278F module without an antenna.** 

**The DRF1278F is a 3.3V supply and logic level device, do not use directly with 5V controller boards such as the Arduino UNO.** 

There are many examples for using this module for GPS trackers or sensors provided in an Arduino library at this link;  [SX12XX Library](https://github.com/StuartsProjects/SX12XX-LoRa)

The pin out of the board is below, the lora device pin names on the outside.
